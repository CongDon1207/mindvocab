# AGENTS.md - Working Conventions

---

## 1) Language
- **Repository artifacts (mandatory)**: All documentation/guides, code comments, and any text written into files must be in **English**.
- **Conversation**: Replies in the chat should be in **Vietnamese**.

---

## 2) Core Principles (Non-negotiable)
- Clarify Ambiguity First: If a requirement is unclear or incomplete, ask 1-2 clarifying questions before proceeding. Never guess.
- Code Only What Was Asked: Follow the PRD/ticket scope strictly; no extra features.
- Minimum Viable Change: Deliver the simplest, most idempotent fix that works; avoid over-engineering.
- Reuse Before Rewriting: Prefer existing modules or utilities; avoid duplication.
- File Length Limit: Keep every file under 300 LOC; if a change would exceed this, pause and propose a refactor or split plan.
- Configuration and Secrets: Load all secrets or config from environment variables only; never hardcode.
- When writing code, aim for simplicity and readability, not just brevity. Short code that is hard to read is worse than slightly longer code that is clear.
- Clean Up Temporary Files: Delete any temporary test files immediately after use.

### Core Directives
- WRITE CODE ONLY TO SPEC.
- MINIMUM, NOT MAXIMUM.
- ONE SIMPLE SOLUTION.
- CLARIFY, DON'T ASSUME.

### Philosophy (Non-negotiables)
- Do not add unnecessary files or modules; if a new file is unavoidable, justify it.
- Do not change architecture or patterns unless explicitly required and justified.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over clever or complex code.

---

## 3) File-reading Rules (Mandatory)
- **Before editing/creating files**: Read all relevant files in full to understand context.
- **Before starting a task**: Read at minimum `README.md` and relevant files in `docs/*` (if present).
- **If docs are missing or likely stale**: Use `rg` to locate the source of truth quickly.

---

## 4) Project Structure Index

> **File**: `docs/structure.md` - Single source of truth for project layout.

### When to use `docs/structure.md`
- **Hard-to-locate tasks** (large repo/monorepo): read it first to get the map and narrow the search area.
- **Very broad keywords** (e.g., auth/payment/logging): use structure to pick the right folder before searching deeper.
- **New project / onboarding**: structure gives a fast overview of the main areas.

### When to use `rg`
- **Normal tasks**: use `rg` directly to find the real implementation (does not depend on whether structure is up to date).
- **You already have concrete identifiers** (file name / function / class / route / endpoint): `rg` is faster than structure.
- **You suspect structure is stale**: prefer `rg` first, then refresh structure if needed.

### When to Update
- **Project has no `docs/structure.md`**: Generate it using `.claude/skills/project-index/SKILL.md`.
- **After major changes**: Added/removed modules, restructured folders.
- **Periodic refresh**: Weekly or when index feels outdated.
- **User says**: "update structure", "refresh index", "scan project".

### How to Generate/Update
```
Load: .claude/skills/project-index/SKILL.md
- Scan project tree
- Identify key files and patterns
- Write to docs/structure.md
```

## 5) Dynamic Context Loading

### Decision Framework: When to Load Skills/Commands
**ALWAYS check catalogs first** before starting any work to determine if a specialized skill/command exists:

1. **User mentions keywords** → Check `.claude/scripts/skills_data.yaml`:
   - Debugging/bug/error/fix → Load `bug-diagnosis` or `debugging` skill
   - Feature/implement/add → Load `feature-implementation` skill
   - Test/testing/unit test → Load `test-generation` skill
   - Documentation/README/docs → Load `documentation` or `readme-improvement` skill
   - Review/code review/PR → Load `code-review` skill
   - Performance/optimize/slow → Load `performance-optimization` skill
   - Security/vulnerability/auth → Load `security-review` skill

2. **User types slash command** (`/fix`, `/test`, etc.) → Load corresponding `.claude/commands/<command>.md`

3. **Complex multi-step tasks** → Load `.claude/workflows/**` for orchestration

4. **If no match found** → Use catalogs to search by description/keywords, or ask user to clarify

**Never skip this step!** Skills contain systematic approaches that prevent random fixes and ensure quality.

### Standard Entry Points (6–8 lines)
- If the request is **complex/unclear**: read `.claude/router/decision-flow.md` to decide the approach.
- If you need the **overall workflow**: read `.claude/workflows/primary-workflow.md`.
- If you need **quality rules**: read `.claude/workflows/development-rules.md`.
- If you need a **command quick reference**: use `.claude/scripts/ck-help.py`.
- If you add/update `.claude/commands/**`: regenerate `.claude/scripts/commands_data.yaml` via `python .claude/scripts/scan_commands.py`.
- If you need a **project map**: create/read `docs/structure.md` via `.claude/skills/project-index/SKILL.md`.
- If you need **exact matches in code**: use `rg` (preferred when you already have concrete keywords).

### Workflows and Agents (When to use)
- Use `.claude/workflows/**` when the task is **multi-step** (plan -> implement -> test -> review -> docs) and you want a consistent execution order.
- Use `.claude/agents/**` when the task needs a specific **mindset/checklist** (e.g., debugging rigor, code review strictness, planning depth).
- If unsure, start with `.claude/router/decision-flow.md` and pick (a) a workflow for structure, then (b) an agent for mindset.

### Catalogs (Auto-generated)
Use these when you need to decide **which command/skill** matches a natural-language request (cross-IDE, no hooks).
- Commands catalog: `.claude/scripts/commands_data.yaml` (generated by `.claude/scripts/scan_commands.py`)
- Skills catalog: `.claude/scripts/skills_data.yaml` (generated by `.claude/scripts/scan_skills.py`)
- If catalogs look stale: re-run the scan scripts to refresh the YAML, then open the matching `.claude/commands/**` or `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`.

### Slash Command Convention (Cross-IDE)
> Slash commands are a **human convention** in this repo (not a guaranteed feature of any IDE). When the user types a slash command, treat it as an instruction to load the matching `.claude` docs and follow that workflow.

1. **Resolve the command**
   - If the prompt starts with `/...`, parse the first token as the command path.
   - Try to open `.claude/commands/<command>.md` or `.claude/commands/<folder>/<command>.md` for nested commands (e.g., `/docs/update`).
   - If no matching file exists, consult `.claude/router/commands-guide.md` (or `.claude/commands/README.md`) and/or `.claude/scripts/commands_data.yaml` to find the closest command, then ask 1 clarifying question if ambiguous.

2. **Where to look (source of truth)**
   - **Routing** (how to decide what to do): `.claude/router/decision-flow.md`
   - **Commands** (step-by-step procedures): `.claude/commands/**`
   - **Agents** (mindset/role): `.claude/agents/**`
   - **Skills** (domain playbooks): `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`
   - **Workflows** (multi-step orchestration): `.claude/workflows/**`
   - **Catalogs** (lookup tables for matching): `.claude/scripts/commands_data.yaml`, `.claude/scripts/skills_data.yaml`

3. **Common mappings**
   - `/fix` -> `.claude/commands/fix.md`
   - `/plan` -> `.claude/commands/plan.md`
   - `/code` -> `.claude/commands/code.md`
   - `/test` -> `.claude/commands/test.md`
   - `/debug` -> `.claude/commands/debug.md`
   - `/review` -> `.claude/commands/review-changes.md`
   - `/docs/update` -> `.claude/commands/docs/update.md`
   - `/scout` -> `.claude/commands/scout.md`
   - `/structure` -> `.claude/skills/project-index/SKILL.md` (generate/read `docs/structure.md`)

---

## 6) Execution Discipline
- **Run only necessary commands**; avoid destructive commands (`rm`, `git reset`...) unless explicitly requested.
- **Timeout**: Default 60s; cap at 70-80s for potentially long-running commands.
- **Permission errors**: Explain clearly and propose safe manual steps.
- **New dependencies**: Do not add unless truly necessary and user agrees.

---

## 7) Auto-Documentation
After completing impactful changes (feature/bugfix/schema/architecture), update briefly:
- `README.md`: If stable info (stack/versions/overview) affected.
- `HANDOFF.md`: Current status + next steps + latest test results.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Add one line: `YYYY-MM-DD: <Fix|Add|Change|Remove> <what> at <path> - <impact> (completed).`
- `docs/structure.md`: If added/removed files or restructured folders.
